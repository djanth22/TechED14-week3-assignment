-What went really well and what could have gone better?

My reflection:

targets I've hit: I managed to fetch the Api data for the shop upgrades, which work to update cookie count and cookies per second, I also managed to implement event listeners to handle user interactions, I've used local storage to save the game progression maintaining the cookie count and cookies per second when reloading the page and set interval was used to both have the cookie count update dependant on the cookies per second number and to make sure the game data is saved every second. The target I'm not as sure about would be target two, while i have used functions to allow effective resuable code I personally wouldn't necesarrily say that its very organised.

my main difficulties, similar to the previous weeks task, was figuring out how to properly write and implement the functions that I needed to translate my ideas into useable code. I knew more or less what I wanted to do just not quite how to properly do it. However, through google searches and looking back on previous workshops and assignments I was able to more or less figure it out. I was hit with a lot of "cannot read properties of null" and "is not a function errors", though after a lot of fiddling it became apparent that these were almost always because I was trying to reference a variable only visible in local scope in respect to its function, or because I hadn't properly referenced the ID, class or variable that I wanted to.
